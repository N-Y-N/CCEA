# CCEA - Code Change Effect Analyzer
------------------------------------
## Purpose : 
This is an experimental project to analyze the flows/paths/areas affected due to a change in code, be it a value change in a variable or a method definition change. It analyzes all the possible flows/paths/areas which might be affected as a result of that change, and displays it in a graphical view.

It greatly helps in reducing the time between the Code Change and Code Delivery. For instance, it helps to know the flows that might affect even before the change is made, and hence Test Cases can be focused more on those parts.

For now, it is still in planning stage.
